  The MK5 Supra can attract looks on the street just as fast as it can attract criticisizm. Here is why:
  </p>
  <p>Some people claim that the Mk5 is good because of it's good looks and its reliable inline 6 engine, but it is not entirley original. Most of the supra's powertrain and platform is shared with the BMW Z4, leading to accusations that it is just a BMW with a Toyota badge.</p>

    <p>Another reason why the MK5 supra is hated so much is that some claim that the MK5 supra doesn't live up to the name 'supra' especially to its predecessor the MK4 supra probably because of the other reasons.</p>

    <p>The design choices also contribute to why people hate the MK5 so much. For example there are fake front air vents on the front of the supra. People think that it is unecessary and detracting from the cars look. Some also dislike the interior of the supra calling it low quality.</p>
    <p>There are a couple more reasons on why people don't like the MK5 supra, but I think it is a nice car that doesn't need to be hated as much.</p>
